# To_do_list


This is a simple To Do List web app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

### Instructions

To use the To Do List, simply follow these steps:

1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Enter a new task in the input box and click the "Add" button.
3. To edit a task, click the "Edit" button next to the task.
4. To delete a task, click the "Remove" button next to the task.

### Code Explanation

The To Do List is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code defines the structure of the web page, the CSS code defines the style of the web page, and the JavaScript code defines the behavior of the web page.

The main components of the To Do List are the input box, the add button, the todo list, and the edit and delete buttons. The input box is where users enter new tasks. The add button is used to add new tasks to the todo list. The todo list displays all of the tasks that have been added. The edit and delete buttons are used to edit and delete tasks from the todo list.

The JavaScript code for the To Do List is responsible for handling user input and updating the todo list. The code uses the DOM API to interact with the HTML elements on the web page.

When the user clicks the "Add" button, the JavaScript code creates a new <li> element and adds it to the todo list. The code also adds a <p> element to the <li> element and sets the text of the <p> element to the value of the input box.

When the user clicks the "Edit" button, the JavaScript code gets the value of the input box and sets the text of the <p> element of the corresponding <li> element to the value of the input box.

When the user clicks the "Delete" button, the JavaScript code removes the corresponding <li> element from the todo list.

I hope this helps!
